# TWA-3-orbit

Determining the architecture of the TWA 3 hierarchical triple system

There is a lot of data on this system, and we want to analyze it in a systematic manner.

1. Aa-Ab tight binary orbit fit with the double-lined RV dataset. Constrains `P_A`, `K_Aa`, `K_Ab`, `e_A`, `omega_Aa`, `gamma_A`, and `phi_A`.
2. Aa-Ab tight binary orbit fit with double-lined RVs, the astrometric constraint from Anthonioz15, and the *Gaia* parallax. Constrains the above RV parameters plus `a_A`, `i_A` and `Omega_Aa`. Derive `M_A` and see what the posterior looks like.
3. Aa-Ab tight binary orbit fit with double-lined RVs, astrometric constraint, parallax, and priors on `M_A` and `gamma_A` from millimeter.
4. [Done] A-B wide binary orbit fit with the astrometric dataset (WDS) and *Gaia* parallax. Constrains `P_AB`, `a_AB`, `Omega_AB`, `omega_AB`, `e_AB`, `phi_AB`.
5. A-B wide binary orbit fit with astrometric dataset and RV information from Keck double-lined solution. Constrains the above astrometric parameters plus `K_A`, `K_B`, `gamma_AB`$.
6. Hierarchical triple orbit simultaneously fit with RV and astrometry for both tight inner binary and wide outer binary: inner: `parallax`, `P_A`, `a_A_ang`, `M_Ab`, `e_A`, `i_A`, `omega_Aa`, `Omega_Aa`, `gamma_A`. `M_A` derived from orbit and fed to triple. outer: `P_B`, `a_B_ang`, `e_AB`, `i_AB`, `omega_A`, `Omega_A`, `gamma_AB`. This has 16 orbital parameters. Adding 4 RV offsets, 2 * 4 RV jitter terms, and 2 astrometric jitter terms makes it 30 parameters total.  
7. Hierarchical triple orbit simultaneously fit including dynamical mass prior on `M_A`.

## A-B wide orbit

There are about 10 epochs of astrometric observations for the wide visual orbit of A-B.

## Aa-Ab tight orbit

There is one epoch of astrometry splitting this pair (`int_data.dat`, from [Anthonioz et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015A&A...574A..41A/abstract)), as well as many double-lined spectroscopic epochs, taken on 4 different instruments.  These data are all from [Kellogg et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...844..168K/abstract)

The dates are listed in HJD - 2,400,000. Generally, the columns of the orbit are something like

    (2,400,000+)	Phase	(km s^-1)	(km s^-1)	(km s^-1)


The following notes are contained in the tables of Kellogg et al.

### du Pont
Notes. RV uncertainties are sigma_Aa = 1.46 km s^-1, sigma_Ab = 2.34 km s^-1, and sigma_B = 3.95 km s^-1 (see text).

There are two epochs which have measurements for only one component.

### CfA
Note. RV uncertainties for the TWA 3A components were determined iteratively from our combined orbital solution (see text) and account for the varying strength of each spectrum.

### FEROS
Note. RV uncertainties are sigma_Aa = 2.61 km s^-1, sigma_Ab = 3.59 km s^-1, and sigma_B = 2.60 km s^-1 (see text).

### KECK
Note. RV uncertainties are sigma_Aa = 0.63 km s^-1, sigma_Ab = 0.85 km s^-1, and sigma_B = 0.59 km s^-1 (see text).
