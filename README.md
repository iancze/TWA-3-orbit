# TWA-3-orbit
Fitting the orbit data on TWA 3

## A-B wide orbit

There are about 10 epochs of astrometric observations for the wide visual orbit of A-B.

To start with, we'll fit these with OFTI to get a sense of the full posterior.

## Aa-Ab tight orbit

There is one epoch of astrometry splitting this pair (`int_data.dat`, from [Anthonioz et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2015A&A...574A..41A/abstract)), as well as many double-lined spectroscopic epochs, taken on 4 different instruments.  These data are all from [Kellogg et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2017ApJ...844..168K/abstract)

The dates are listed in HJD - 2,400,000. Generally, the columns of the orbit are something like

    (2,400,000+)	Phase	(km s^-1)	(km s^-1)	(km s^-1)


The following notes are contained in the tables of Kellogg et al.

### du Pont
Notes. RV uncertainties are sigma_Aa = 1.46 km s^-1, sigma_Ab = 2.34 km s^-1, and sigma_B = 3.95 km s^-1 (see text).

There are two epochs which have measurements for only one component.

### CfA
Note. RV uncertainties for the TWA 3A components were determined iteratively from our combined orbital solution (see text) and account for the varying strength of each spectrum.

### FEROS
Note. RV uncertainties are sigma_Aa = 2.61 km s^-1, sigma_Ab = 3.59 km s^-1, and sigma_B = 2.60 km s^-1 (see text).

### KECK
Note. RV uncertainties are sigma_Aa = 0.63 km s^-1, sigma_Ab = 0.85 km s^-1, and sigma_B = 0.59 km s^-1 (see text).
